 ## TweetClone

First of all, I have to say my app based on MiniTwit.

Link:
https://github.com/pallets/flask/tree/master/examples/minitwit

So:
This is a SQLite and Flask powered twitter clone with some "sprint backlog".

If you want to use this app, you have to :
1. run minitwit.py
2. tell flask about the right application: export FLASK_APP=minitwit.py
3. fire up a shell and run this: flask initdb
4. now you can run minitwit: flask run


The application will greet you on:  
http://localhost:5000/
